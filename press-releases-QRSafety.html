          <h1>Atomic Asher LLP Unveils "QR Safety" App</h1>
          <p class="date-location">Mumbai, 3rd November, 2023</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Atomic Asher LLP, an innovator in the cybersecurity arena, is
            thrilled to announce the launch of "QR Safety by Atomic Asher," a
            cutting-edge mobile application designed to fortify digital safety.
            Now available for free on the Apple App Store and Android Play
            Store, the app integrates AI and Machine Learning to offer real-time
            protection against QR code threats, including the emerging danger of
            quishing.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>A Multilingual Guardian in Your Pocket</h3>
          <p>
            QR Safety speaks your language, quite literally. With its
            multilingual interface and more languages to come, the app ensures
            that global users can effortlessly utilize its safety features,
            making digital protection an accessible asset worldwide.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>AI-Powered Scanning for Unparalleled Security</h3>
          <p>
            The app's AI-driven scanning technology meticulously evaluates QR
            codes and URLs, safeguarding users against malicious content. This
            proactive measure is crucial in combating quishing, a deceptive
            practice where QR codes are weaponized to mislead users into
            exposing personal information.
          </p>
          <br />
